# Node Cookie Auth

My version of alex996's [node-auth](https://github.com/alex996/node-auth). Check that repo for the original implementation. This was made with JavaScript instead of TypeScript and PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB.

I just wanted to see what it was like to build a secure login system. I will reiterate on this project as I learn (and want to implement) more about this topic.

I also have made a frontend for this, [check it out!](https://github.com/franxz/svelte-cookie-auth/)
